#The ABC company is building a basketball court for its employees to improve company morale. You are creating a Python program that employees can use to keep track of their average score.
#The program must allow users to enter their name and current scores. The program will output the user name and the userâ€™s average score. The output must meet the following requirements:

#-  The user name must be left-aligned.
#- If the user name has fewer than 20 characters, additional space must be added to the right.
#- The average score must have three places to the left of the decimal point and one place to the right of the decimal (XXX.X).
